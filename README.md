> Monorepo for personal bleeding-edge experiments and mad science

> **Disclaimer:** All projects contained on this repo are practical implementations of hypothesis that should be considered as experimental and by no means be safe or stable for a production scenario, their API might change at any time without any prior notice

### Concept

In short, this repo is divided into branches, each one being a completely unrelated project (also referred internally as "subject") from another, where i test shower thoughts and some other random ideas, might include some fanciful stuff
